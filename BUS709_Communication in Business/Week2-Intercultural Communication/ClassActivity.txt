Group 4: Nepal

Student 4: Namaste, everyone! I'm from Nepal. Nepali customs are deeply rooted in Hindu and Buddhist traditions. One common custom is touching elders' feet as a sign of respect. Traditional dress for men is the "Daura Suruwal," a knee-length wrap-around garment with a shirt, while women wear the "Sari" or "Kurta Suruwal." The flag of Nepal is unique, consisting of two triangular pennants joined together with a blue border. The upper pennant is red, symbolizing bravery, while the lower one is blue, representing peace. Nepali cuisine is diverse, with popular dishes like dal bhat (lentil soup with rice), momo (dumplings), and gundruk (fermented leafy greens). Geographically, Nepal is a landlocked country in South Asia, known for its stunning Himalayan mountains, including Mount Everest. An interesting fact is that Nepal is home to various ethnic groups and languages, making it culturally rich and diverse.
